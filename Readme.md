####Weekend 5 Restaurant Page


This weekend assignment required our group of three to create a mockup of a website for a restaurant.

The bulk of new material tried to master this week dealt with merging our individual branches with the master branch on github so we could all contribute content without erasing each other's work. We learned to resolve merge conflicts. We learned to never ever not on your life push to master.


We also used the familiar ajax request function to an API for whatever that API holds whether its images, restaurant data, or access to Goggle maps.

We also used css to create hovers. We used flex box to reposition elements on the page and their immediate children.
We also relearned that styling is a tedious process and brings out everyone's neuroses.
