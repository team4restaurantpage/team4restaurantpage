          <img id ="guzman" src="./images/guzmanchef.jpg"/> <p>It began the summer of 2010 when I graduated from high school. I decided to uproot myself and travel outside of the United States until I ran out of money or interest in leading a nomadic lifestyle. I never experienced life as a nomad, though, as my first and only trip was to the Democratic Republic of North Korea. In January of 2010, North Korea changed its policy to allow U.S. travelers to visit on official guided tours any time of the year.</p>
     <p>My visa was accepted without issue, after which I was able to enter the country to take a guided tour. The funny thing is, no one noticed when my visa expired, and I never left. I struggle to make an impression or stay on anyone’s radar, so to fall off the map in North Korea felt like an opportunity had risen from my blandness. I started working as a busy boy at a restaurant that gained huge popularity after the government erected a monument to Kim Il Sung next to it. Everyone loves him, and everyone loves to hang around statutes and plaques and anything else commemorative.</p>
     <p>One day, I guess due to poor craftsmanship, the monument fell right into the restaurant where I work. My employer and his wife were killed. I survived along with three other bus boys and a dish washer. Government officials came and immediately took away my coworkers as criminals, blaming them for the damage caused to the monument from when it fell into the restaurant. They left me alone, like they always do. I went to my employers house, to see what I could take since no one cared his was gone, or even noticed. I put on his clothes and shoes. I tried his cologne and used comb to part my hair like he did. I ate dinner sitting at his seat at the table. I felt comfortable there—in his seat, in his clothes, in his home. I sold all his worthwhile belongings I had no interest in, and I used to the money to repair the restaurant. In the end, I took his home, his possessions, his restaurant, and even his name. That is how I came to own and run KJI Public House. I take pride in my place of work every day. I hope you enjoy our Special of the Day!</p></div>
